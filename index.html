    Hellos, da vos
I see you need me for developing a simple site.
I see also that you put on skills like: PHP, AngularJs, MySql. I have to tell you that I am not qualified in those skills.

But I have strong knowledge of HTML,CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery for animations and objects manipulations.
I am very interested in this job, but please give me more details and If you need just my skills.

Thank you,
Wait for you answer,
Iulian Bubolea
